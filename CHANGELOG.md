# Changelog

All notable changes to Bandolier will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **WebSocket origin enforcement** in `/ws/deployments/{id}/logs` and `/ws/apps/installs/{id}/logs`. Previously `OriginPatterns: []string{"*"}` allowed any origin; replaced with default same-origin enforcement (the request host is always authorized; nothing else by default). Operators who run the UI on a different origin than the API (e.g. `npm run dev` against a remote API) can set `BANDOLIER_WS_ORIGIN_PATTERNS` (comma-separated host patterns, `path.Match` syntax) to allow additional origins. The HMAC WS token continues to authenticate the client; this change closes the cross-origin replay window for a leaked token.

### Added

- `SECURITY.md` documenting the vulnerability disclosure process, supported versions, and what is in and out of scope for security reports.
- Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests (forms-style), plus a `config.yml` that disables blank issues and links to security advisories and discussions.
- Pull request template with type-of-change checkboxes, test plan, and a no-secrets-in-diff reminder.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-07

Initial public release.

### Added

- Self-contained Docker Compose stack that deploys k3s clusters on Proxmox.
- React UI for cluster initialization, deployment, destroy, and Helm app installs.
- Go API driving Terraform (VM provisioning) and Ansible (k3s + Traefik configuration) over a Proxmox API token.
- Containerized HashiCorp Vault (KV v2 + PKI + AppRole) for credential storage.
- `vault-agent` long-running watcher that auto-unseals Vault on restart, eliminating the manual unseal step that breaks operators after host reboots.
- Master-password authentication; AppRole-scoped tokens for the API; never-on-host Vault deployment.
- Wildcard TLS issuance via internal PKI; live deployment log streaming over WebSocket.
- Profiles for homelab, blue-team, red-team, and grey-space cluster shapes (single-cluster v0.1; multi-cluster scenarios planned).
- App ecosystem with bundle installs (Helm charts grouped by use case).
- Audit log of operator actions with structured action constants.

### Notes

- Pre-1.0: minor version bumps may include breaking changes. We'll call them out explicitly here.
- The Vault threat model (single-host, single-operator, plaintext unseal keys on a docker volume) is documented in [`deploy/vault-init/THREAT_MODEL.md`](deploy/vault-init/THREAT_MODEL.md). If you need a different trust model, see that file for guidance.
