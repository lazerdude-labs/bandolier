## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-07

Initial public release.

### Added

- Self-contained Docker Compose stack that deploys k3s clusters on Proxmox.
- React UI for cluster initialization, deployment, destroy, and Helm app installs.
- Go API driving Terraform (VM provisioning) and Ansible (k3s + Traefik configuration) over a Proxmox API token.
- Containerized HashiCorp Vault (KV v2 + PKI + AppRole) for credential storage.
- `vault-agent` long-running watcher that auto-unseals Vault on restart, eliminating the manual unseal step that breaks operators after host reboots.
- Master-password authentication; AppRole-scoped tokens for the API; never-on-host Vault deployment.
- Wildcard TLS issuance via internal PKI; live deployment log streaming over WebSocket.
- Profiles for homelab, blue-team, red-team, and grey-space cluster shapes (single-cluster v0.1; multi-cluster scenarios planned).
- App ecosystem with bundle installs (Helm charts grouped by use case).
- Audit log of operator actions with structured action constants.

### Notes

- Pre-1.0: minor version bumps may include breaking changes. We'll call them out explicitly here.
- The Vault threat model (single-host, single-operator, plaintext unseal keys on a docker volume) is documented in [`deploy/vault-init/THREAT_MODEL.md`](deploy/vault-init/THREAT_MODEL.md). If you need a different trust model, see that file for guidance.
